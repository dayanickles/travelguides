				<center><h3> FILIPINO PEOPLE </h3></center>
				<p> Those that have had the pleasure of traveling around the Philippines can 
				attest to the warm and friendly vibe that most Filipinos exude. Known for our 
				penchant for being hospitable, giving out smiles and loving karaoke, don’t be 
				surprised if you find yourself drinking shots with locals singing Bon Jovi at 
				the top of your lungs.
				<br>
				Another characteristic that Filipinos are known for is their 
				admirable trait of resiliency. Often caught in the most horrific of natural 
				disasters, the Filipino spirit is waterproof and is able to bounce back with smiles
				on their faces despite the challenging times.</p>
